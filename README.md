Git Clone is a command that is used to clone a remote git repository onto a local machine. This links your machine to the local repository and changes can be made and pushed to the remote repository with other git commands.

git init is a command that initializes a new Git repository in your current directory. It sets up all the necessary files and folders so you can start tracking changes to your project.

git commit is a command that permanently records the staged changes in the repository with a message describing the update. The -m flag lets you include a short summary of what was done. 

git push is a command that uploads your commits from the local repository to a remote repository, such as GitHub. This is how you share your work with others or back it up online.


git pull is a command that fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your current branch. It helps keep your local code up to date with the latest changes from collaborators.
